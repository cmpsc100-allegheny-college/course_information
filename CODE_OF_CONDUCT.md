# CMPSC 100: Course Contract

## A word from the Mayor's Office

We're building a world. 

That task shouldn't be taken on as a solitary or easy burden. In many ways, world-building is always imperfect; we learn more as we _do_, and that process is rarely (i.e. never) linear or "clean." We benefit from being able to be messy and make many mistakes. Following the various processes of `term-world` closely should yield a successful product. That written, production is a _basic_ expectation of the work we'll complete together. Once the process is over, we need to have a result.

However, there are manifold tasks involved that are often under-counted in traditional grading. That's why community members are evaluated on a _contract basis_, the terms of which are spelled out here. This document specifies your responsibilities and how that work will be rewarded. 

We're able to substantially alter the terms of this deal (see [the "Rules Rule"](#the-rules-rule) below), though we won't do so without participation in course governance.

## Contract stipulations

### The `Basic Grade`

* All citizens who meet the basic covenants of this contract will earn an individual letter grade of `C` in this course

You may ask why the `Basic Grade` is a `C` and _not a `B` or `B-`_.

Rising to the level of above-average or exceptional work relies on the just that: above-average or exceptional work. Merely completing the assignments maintains a kind of _status quo_. As our interest centers on making a _better_ world, this contract should provide incentives to think beyond mere sufficiency. As you'll see below, work that aspires to higher levels of reward involves doing the work of planning and (better yet) _making_ improvements.

### Improvements

**Opportunities to implement improvements will begin during the week 5's `Bodega` assignment.**

Much of the language below will not make complete sense until we're into the collaborative portion of our work. That will come a bit later.

Improvements are small additions to assignments that extend your service in `term-world`. They serve as a way to:

* gain extra practice with course concepts
* demonstrate an above-average level of effort

Each "improvable" assignment will suggest `10` potential improvements to choose from. Selecting from this list, improvements must be unique (i.e. two students in the same neighborhood cannot complete the same improvement).

#### Improvement `Proposal`s

Improvements must go through a formal proposal process. To propose an assignment-related world improvement, citizens must use the `Improvement Proposal` template for a given GitHub repository's `Issues` which:

  * responds to the templates questions/prompts
  * is completed by the start of a lab session of a given week
  * must be approved _in writing_ by the Mayor by the end of the lab session
    * the Office of the Mayor will provide suggestions and approval via the `Issue` filed to propose the improvement
  * must either incorporate suggested changes or provide rationale for _not_ incorporating them

#### Improvement `Implementation`

Proposing an improvement allows a citizen to _implement_ (i.e. make) that improvement. To implement an improvement:

   * create a separate `branch` for improvement work, which features an appropriate title
   * make all relevant changes on that `branch`
   * `push` that `branch` to GitHub
   * open a `Pull Request` via the assignment repository
   * link the `Issue` containing the proposal to the created `Pull Request`
     * do this using the `Development` section of the `Issue` (located on the right sidebar)
   * request review of at least `3` neighborhood members and `1` member of the Office of the Mayor

### Grading

**To qualify for grade levels beyond (and including) the `Basic Grade`, all basic assignment objectives must be completed.**

The table below summarizes evaluative outcomes.

|Final letter grade |Assignments completed |Proposals completed |Improvements implemented |
|:------------------|:---------------------|:-------------------|:------------------------|
|`A`                | 10                   |5                   |5                        |
|`A-`               | 10                   |5                   |4                        |
|`B+`               | 10                   |4                   |4                        |
|`B`                | 10                   |4                   |3                        |
|`B-`               | 10                   |4                   |2                        |
|`C+`               | 10                   |2                   |1                        |
|`C`                | 10                   |-                   |-                        |

See [below](#grades-lower-than-the-basic-grade) for elaboration on letter grades below the `Basic Grade`.

#### Grades lower than the Basic Grade

There are three (3) situations which penalize evaluation:

1. `Incomplete` assignments (i.e. basic expectations are not fulfilled)
2. `Ignored` assignments (i.e. no evidence of assignment attempt)
3. Plagiarism or other inappropriate/dishonest academic behavior

Each of these circumstances affects evaluation differently.

##### Note about assignment completion

This agreement operates on the understanding that circumstances may arise which interfere with completing assignments on time. Should a citizen need more time to complete work, they should arrange an assignment extension with the Mayor.

#### `Incomplete` assignments

* For every two (2) incomplete assignments, a citizen's course grade will be lowered by half a letter grade
  * e.g. _two_ (2) incomplete assignments would result in a mark of `C-`, et al.

#### `Ignored` assignments

* If a citizen does not make an attempt to `push` work for an assignment, their course grade is lowered by a half letter grade for each such assignment
  * e.g. _one_ (1) assignment missed would result in a `C-`, et al.

#### Plagiarism or other inappropriate/dishonest academic behavior

Citizens engaging in academically dishonest behavior will be assessed on a case-by-case basis, as circumstances and factors of a case vary widely. Typically, academic dishonesty is referred to the Allegheny College Honor Code Committee. For questions of what qualifies under the provision of "academic dishonesty" see the remainder of this document and the _Compass_.

Steps in the Allegheny College process are located in the [Allegheny College Honor Code](http://catalog.allegheny.edu/content.php?catoid=43&navoid=1510).

### Assignment "bugs" and impact on grading

* In the event that there are "bugs" with grader criteria, Mayor will assess completion status with known issues in mind
  * The Mayor will make every effort to remedy the failing check before the assignment due date
  * However, if during assignment evaluation, a check fails for every citizen due to a technical issue, the check is considered an invalid grading criteria 

#### Bug bounty

To mitigate future issues the Mayor has instituted a "bug bounty." This is a way for you, the citizens, to surface issues with the world. To report a "bug," a citizen must:

* complete a `Bug Report` template on a given repository's `Issues` tab
  
A member of the Office of the Mayor may be in touch to ask about reproducing or observing the bug. Should the report be classified as a "bug," a scaled, appropriate non-letter grade reward will be awarded and announced to citizens at-large.

### The "Rules Rule"

Covenants in this contract may be changed. This requires a citizen or group of citizens to:
  * make a successful "Pull Request" on this document _and_
  * lead an open course discussion about the proposed change(s)

Any changes will then be put to a vote.

  * If a vote succeeds with a two-thirds majority (66%) outcome supporting the measure(s) proposed, the change will be made 

The above applies to all portions of the contract _except_ for the `Basic Grade` and this rule ("Rules Rule").

The Mayor reserves the following rights:

  * the right to veto a proposed change if:
    * the change substantially alters the academic or course community integrity or safety
    * a rule is superseded by College policies or academic standards
  * the right to make unilateral changes that uphold academic and community integrity or safety

### Participation

For the duration of this course, take "participation" to mean some combination of:

* Helping in group activities
* Completing assignments
* Listens to class instruction
* Giving full effort to class activities
* Actively contributing to collaborative assignments
* Being prepared for class by completing work outside of class hours
* For group assignments, each member of the group should appear in the "Contributors" list
* Respect neighborhood members' working hours
  * If a member prefers not to work past 9:00p, recognize that their participation and time may be limited to a certain window each day and that this window may not always be the same
  * However, make your best effort to be available to peers in your neighborhood rather than setting extremely restrictive hours

Please note that none of the above definitions _requires verbal contribution_ -- while this is a _way_ to participate, it is not the _only_ way. Activity on GitHub may also constitute full participation, if efforts display the above qualities. Occasionally, for group assignments, your neighborhood may receive a level of effort survey to gauge peer appraisal of team contribution as well.

As several of you note in your suggestions for this contract, it is good practice to consider your participation not only necessary for _your own success_, but _required for the success of your neighborhood as a whole_.

#### Communicating in your neighborhoods

The Office of the Mayor expects neighborhoods to use their GitHub neighborhood pages to coordinate working hours.

#### Course platforms

On course platforms used for the duration of the semester:

* Use all platforms for appropriate class reasons
* Follow the instructions while using the platforms
* Keeping "up-to-date" with platforms may require seeking additional extra-curricular knowledge
  * For example, using Markdown in Discord
* Respect others' thoughts, time, and contributions to either discussion or code product
* Check course platforms often -- at least twice a day
  * The best times to review are often the beginning and ends of a day
    * i.e.: 8:00 (beginning), 18:00 (end)

In addition, I suggest that you at least download and install the Discord application, rather than use the web interface. This is not required, but will help greatly with your ability to keep up with notifications.

#### Using office hours

When using office hours:

* Come in prepared with questions, a topic, or a clear objective
  * To achieve this, please add notes about expected topic(s) to a Google Calendar slot reservation (for instructor calendar)
* Be prepared to receive feedback, understanding that typically this means completing revisions on what ever you are working on
* Respect the time of other citizens (i.e. be mannerly and quick)
* Have all assignments ready to discuss with the Professor
* Not rely only on office hours (i.e. work should be attempted first)
 
#### Attendance

Especially in precarious times like those in which we find ourselves, I _cannot_ and _will not_ require you to be physically present for class sessions. However, if you feel well and comfortable, I (and your peers) ask that you attend class.

As many of you note, this isn't something that I provide grading criteria for. I don't really have an interest in directly grading attendance. However, _not attending_ traditionally shows up in final products and, thereby, grades. It's important to remember that attendance and participation are closely related. Not doing either severely restricts your ability to succeed in the course.

It is, however, also possible that a citizen may not feel well enough to attend even a portion of a remote course. In these situations, citizens must:

* Use their neighborhood as a source of knowledge for given content missed
* Failing the neighborhood's ability to "crowd-source" an answer, citizens should [use office hours](#Using-office-hours) to make up the gap in understanding
  * These hours _must be_ with the Mayor, and not a TL if intending to "catch up" on missed work
  * citizens who have missed a class may use TL office hour time to if they feel that they understand the content, but have questions about approach or methods       

### Collaboration

This course works due to the trust the Mayor places in each neighborhood becoming a collaborative home for all citizens. However, there is a fine line between collaboration and academic dishonesty. Here, we define that that line is and what general consequences (positive or negative) are under it.

As a rule, some assignments are _group assignments_, and expect a single neighborhood-built product. This is both collaborative and co-creative. 

Every assignment, however, is collaborative, meaning that you have unlimited access to the members of your neighborhood for insight and advice.

Both of the above assignment types operate on the assumption that members, instead of just sharing code and working solutions:

* Share tips and tricks
* Help others in understanding core concepts
* Plan, sketch, or otherwise draft general approaches (not full solutions)

#### Neighborhood assignments

For all neighborhood assignments, members will fill out a post-assignment assessment to determine individual level of effort (LoE).

* Contribute any and all ideas, even if you aren't sure it'll work or is correct
* Be respectful of other people's ideas and their misunderstandings
* Help where you can and be honest when you don't know what's going; it's very likely a peer can help you
  * If you exhaust peer assistance, it's certain that your neighborhood feels the way you do; this is the time to get the attention of the instructor and/or TLs
* Be non-judgemental of others opinions
  * Often, the idea that feels the most radical can provide a way forward
* _Do_ assist others in your neighborhood, but _may not type directly on their keyboards_
  * _Do Not_ do this: if noticed repeatedly, this behavior may cause their neighborhood to lose neighborhood course points
* _Do_ use resources like [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
  * _Do Not_ copy/paste code directly from these resources; this, as many of you recognize, is a violation of the Honor Code

To the above behaviors, the following are acceptable ways to assist:

* Remind any individual of important commands 
* Remind any individual of the orders in which certain commands need to be given
* Watch any individual write code and help guide them, while still allowing room for the individual to think and figure out how to get around obstacles on their own

#### Individual assignments

While certain assignments should be achieved individually citizens have access to collaborators. However, keep in mind that, like "group" assignments, in pursuit of individual assignments:

* _Do_ assist others in your neighborhood, but _may not type directly on their keyboards_
  * _Do Not_ do this: if noticed repeatedly, this behavior may cause their neighborhood to lose neighborhood course points
* _Do_ use resources like [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
  * _Do Not_ copy/paste code directly from these resources; this, as many of you recognize, is a violation of the Honor Code

### Technical Leaders

This course features the assistance of several peer educators that the department refers to as Technical Leaders (TLs). You should recognize these citizens as quasi-authorities in this course. While they don't make any kinds of grading decisions, they are all much smarter than the course instructor. They're also much cleverer.

These people are not course resources in the sense that they are inanimate machines (also unlike your charitable Mayor). You agree to:

* Treat them courteously and with respect
* Not make strict demands of them; their engagement with the course is a privilege, not a right
* Recognize that their feedback won't give you the "answer"; like instruction in this course, they're excellent resources to help you _reason_
* Consider interaction with TLs should attain the same level as interaction with the instructor

In the event that a conflict arises with a TL, please message the course instructor. Know that any issues that TLs have with citizens _are reported to me_, and if we need to discuss your engagement with them, the instructor agrees to arbitrate the issue with fairness to all involved.

### The "Repair Rule" (i.e. Assignment Revision)

This rule only applies to assignments classified as "Incomplete" assignments and _not_ "Ignored" assignments.

* _Once_ during the semester, a citizen may open an Issue on a repository to which they'd like to submit missing work to regain credit for an assignment
  * This issue should indicate a citizen's interest in reclaiming credit for this assignment using the "Repair Rule"
* This "Repair" issue must fill out the resulting form completely to request the ability to submit revisions
* Citizens submitting a revision must remedy deficiencies listed in the most recent "Assignment Progress" issue
  * Credit will be awarded as "complete" or "incomplete" according to the guidelines outlined in the [Grading](#Grading) section above
* A citizen submitting a revision is allowed five (5) days to submit updated work
  * There is no limit on the number of `commit`s allowed during this time (i.e. citizens may `commit` as many times as they like)
* This rule _does not apply_ to missed `Proposal`s or `Implementation`s.
