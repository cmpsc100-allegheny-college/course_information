## Course description

> An introduction to the principles of computer science with an emphasis on creative expression through the
medium of a programming language. Participating in hands-on activities that often require teamwork,
students learn the computational structures needed to solve problems and produce computational artifacts
which address these problems in real-world contexts. Students also learn how to organize and document a
program's source code so that it effectively communicates with the intended users and maintainers.
Additionally, the introduction includes an overview of the discipline of computer science and
computational thinking. During a weekly laboratory session students use industry-grade technology to
complete projects, reporting on their results through both written documents and oral presentations.
Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of
laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions.

* Distribution requirements: `ME`,`SP`

### Less canonical (but still very official) Mayoral Stance

Some interpretations of the subject treat "computer science" as a kind of sacrosanct technical knowledge. And that is somewhat true: to some, it serves as a characterization of how skills learned as part of how the discipline is exercised in service of implementing or achieving a technical goal. There are certainly technical constructs that programmers have to obey and rules that, while somewhat pliable, are relatively inflexible. Undoubtedly, you'll encounter frustration in this course with conventions arising from technical agreements which may seem arbitrary.

The above description of the discipline does it little service and neglects to contemplate the kinds of procrustean, dictatorial constructs that those with the ability to create systems (i.e. ability to "code") can force socities to struggle under. Rather than letting technical requirements impose themselves on you, this course is meant to impart the skills to ask productive questions about _how_ and _why_ we might structure a world a particular way. In some cases—as we'll see later in the course—these questions provide more than just an intellectual exercise: there are troubling real-world implications of the ways that computer science has been and will be used both in- and outside this classroom. From data breaches to threats to identity, we've all experienced these forces and the toll they take on our lives.

By the end of the course, our hope is that this awareness and (hopefully) the desire to build a better world emerge. Learning the literacy of computer code gives you a valuable power. It's our goal to figure out how to use it wisely in the larger world. What better way than to _build one_?

## Required materials

### Textbook(s)

There are no textbooks for this course. Any texts or articles used will be available online or distributed by the Mayor. (Oh, how nice the Mayor is.)

### Platforms

This course relies on the [GitHub](https://www.github.com), Discord, and [`term-world`](https://world.theterm.world) platforms. Your work will be assigned and evaluated using these platforms and official course communication will take place through them. You are expected to sign up for accounts and remain active on these platforms throughout the semester.

#### A note on use of class platforms

These platforms are for our use only. To use them, you'll need to register and be logged into accounts associated with your Allegheny College email.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

* Apply Python programming language primitives to describe and develop computer programs that solve computational problems,
* Use VSCode, git, and GitHub to develop, version, and release code consistent with industry-standard practices,
* Analyze and suggest revisions to existing Python language code to improve or add functionality,
* Evaluate the practical and ethical implications of computer programs written to solve computational problems,
* Design, describe, and implement original projects incorporating standard practices and Python language principles

## Governance and evaluation

This course's evaluation, participation and, eventually, grades, are governed by the [Course Contract](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

This, however, does not abrogate the role of this syllabus document. Provisions here work together with the contract. You should consider the information provided here the basic "givens" of the course.

### Assignments

All course assignments are assigned and evaluated using the GitHub platform. I will only assess work correctly deposited there. While we use the `term-world` environment for _doing_ the work, the final versions _must_ be on GitHub. Though the previous set of statements implies the following, I state it explicitly here to avoid misunderstanding: 

> I _will not_ grade work left on the `term-world` server. 

In fact, _I can't_. This means that all the work that you complete below must be submitted to GitHub _by the due date and time_. For more information on how this affects course standing, see the [Course Contract](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

#### Workbook projects

Each Monday, you will complete various short, guided projects. We will reserve time on Monday for questions and a brief walk-through of the project, pointing out key aspects that will become important for your work on Weekly Projects (see below).

The Workbook is assessed on a completion basis, meaning that you are expected to complete each short project.

#### Weekly projects

At the start of a given week, a larger week-long project will be assigned to you and/or your neighborhood. These constitute the bulk of the work of the course, and are governed by provisions in the [Course Contract](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

##### Briefing Reports

These assignments will ask you to report on your work for the week in a structured format that may require some reflective thinking. These writing assignments arrive bundled with and are specific to a given Weekly Project.

#### Course project

This project offers students the opportunity to develop a realized version of an reasonably complex student-created project. Completion of this project will require use of the knowledge accumulated throughout the semester. Details for this project will be given out at the approximate mid-point of the semester. This task will require planning, careful evaluation, and implementation of a wide variety of concepts, and will allow students to choose and implement a project of their chosen discipline/application and approaches/methods. This project will be subject to approval by the Mayor through a process including a formal proposal, interim updates, and technical reports.

### Course preparation

I expect students to arrive to class prepared. Here, "prepared" means having completed reading assignments, compiled questions, and being ready to engage thoughtfully with course material. In order to assist students' preparedness efforts, I will provide a [schedule]() with assignments and will accompany all videos with a copy of any slides used in class proceedings or recorded media.

## Allegheny College Policy and Awareness Statements

### Statement of Community

>  Allegheny students and employees are committed to creating an inclusive, respectful and safe residential learning community that will actively confront and challenge racism, sexism, heterosexism, religious bigotry, and other forms of harassment and discrimination. We encourage individual growth by promoting a free exchange of ideas in a setting that values diversity, trust and equality. So that the right of all to participate in a shared learning experience is upheld, Allegheny affirms its commitment to the principles of freedom of speech and inquiry, while at the same time fostering responsibility and accountability in the exercise of these freedoms.

### Academic Integrity

Allegheny College has a student-run Honor Code designed to promote individual responsibility and integrity in academic affairs. Each student pledges the following: "I hereby recognize and pledge to fulfill my responsibilities, as defined in the Honor Code, and to maintain the integrity of both myself and the College community as a whole." Given the eminently shareable and reproducible nature of code, the Department of Computer and Information Science adds the following statement to the general college policy:

> It is recognized that an important part of the learning process in any course, and particularly in computer science, derives from thoughtful discussions with teachers, student assistants, and fellow students.  Such dialogue is encouraged.  However, it is necessary to distinguish carefully between the student who discusses the principles underlying a problem with others, and the student who produces assignments that are identical to, or merely variations on, someone else’s work.  It will therefore be understood that all assignments submitted to faculty of the Department of Computer Science are to be the original work of the student submitting the assignment, and should be signed in accordance with the provisions of the Honor Code.  Appropriate action will be taken when assignments give evidence that they were derived from the work of others.

As the nature of "plagiarism" and constituents of "fair use" change often, the department encourages you to periodically review the specific tenets of the general college Honor Code provided in the latest course catalog and in the _Compass_.

The above statement, of course, also applies to online forums such as Stack Overflow, et al.

### Classroom ethics

The discipline of computer science, like many others, encourages its members to act according to discipline-specific ethics. I encourage you to take time to review the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) [Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/about/acm-code-of-ethics-booklet.pdf).

### Seeking assistance

#### Assistance with course concepts

Students who struggle to understand knowledge and skills defined in this course are encouraged to seek assistance from the Mayor and teaching assistants. To meet with me, consult my available office hours (above) and make an appointment.

Historically, students who are successful in my courses visit and discuss course concepts with the Mayor and Technical Leaders early and often. See [above for my office hours](#office-hours) or go to [this schedule for Technical Leaders' office hours](https://www.cs.allegheny.edu/teaching/technicalleaders/).

#### Assistance outside of the course

If you find yourself in difficult circumstances which affect your ability to participate in or complete course work, let me know immediately. Full stop.

Do not wait until the end of the semester. 

Part of my job as the Mayor of `term-world` is to make sure that students receive the assistance they need. Do not hesitate to let me know if there is anything I can do with respect to your ability to handle your work. This is especially true of our current circumstances. Again, let me remind you -- __**it is part of my job**__ to help you access Allegheny College resources that will enable your safety and success.

#### Educational Accommodations (prepared by SASS)

Students with disabilities who believe they may need accommodations in this class are encouraged to contact Student Accessibility and Support Services (SASS) at (814) 332-2898.  Student Accessibility and Support Services is located in Pelletier Library.  Please do this as soon as possible to ensure that such accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion. Please see [student accessibility website](https://sites.allegheny.edu/studentaccessibility) for more details.

#### Religious Observance (prepared by SRL)

If you need to miss class or reschedule a final examination due to a religious observance, please speak to the professor well in advance to make arrangements. Please see [religious holidays website](https://sites.allegheny.edu/religiouslife/religious-holy-days) for more details.

#### Academic Alerts (prepared by MCSS)

Allegheny College uses an Academic Alert system to send progress notices to the class deans in the Maytum Center for Student Success (MCSS). The progress notices are not punitive. They are an opportunity to connect you with your class dean who can offer additional support and suggest resources if you need assistance. These notices may encourage faculty advisors, coaches (for student-athletes), or other support staff to provide outreach to you as well.

#### Mental Health and Wellness (prepared by Wellness in Student Life)

As a college student, there may be times when personal stressors, struggles, and/or traumas interfere with your academic performance and/or negatively impact your daily life. Allegheny College recognizes that mental health is an important piece of the holistic human experience, and that this experience influences your academic success. We encourage students to prioritize their mental well-being by seeking services and support as needed.

Keep in mind, course deadlines, absences, and accommodations for mental health are subject to the course policies and expectations that are set within this syllabus. Students are encouraged to communicate with their professors as soon as possible regarding their needs and seek support if their mental health impacts their academic performance or daily life. When you find yourself struggling emotionally, remember that there are supports available, and you are not alone.

Students who are in need of mental health support can access multiple resources to receive support.  The 98.6 CampusCare app provides physical and behavioral health consultation and supports free of charge 24/7 via telehealth for any actively enrolled student who downloads and signs up with their smartphone.  Allegheny College has also partnered with ECPS (Edinboro Counseling and Psychological Services) to provide in-person therapy on campus. The ECPS partnership with Allegheny College delivers holistic mental health services to the Allegheny College student community through brief individual counseling, and crisis support. Students may request services from ECPS by calling (814) 332-4368 or by emailing the Wellness Case Manager at wellness@allegheny.edu.

If you or someone you know is experiencing a mental health emergency, please call the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, Public Safety (814-332-3357), or 911. All of these urgent resources are available 24/7/365.  When in doubt, reach out.

#### Gator Success Grants

The Gator Success Grant program is designed to provide students with additional financial assistance to offset the total cost of college attendance and to encourage successful on-time degree completion. Currently enrolled students who have an unanticipated need are invited to apply. Grants are usually from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars, depending on the request and the student’s need. Please direct questions to `studentsuccess@allegheny.edu`.

#### Class Deans (prepared by MCSS) 

The Office of Class Deans in Pelletier Library serves as a place for students to begin seeking assistance and answers to their questions related to college life. If you have a question and don’t know who to ask – ask a class dean. If you want advice – talk to a class dean. Erin O’Day-Frye is the First Year Class Dean, Amy Stearns is the Second Year Class Dean / Director of Transfer Advising, and Jonathon May is the Third/Fourth Year Class Dean. Please contact them individually or through `studentsuccess@allegheny.edu``.

#### Recording Policy (prepared by Campus Life and Community Standards Committee)

In remote teaching and learning contexts, there is an understanding that instructors (including faculty, coaches, staff, and facilitators) have the right to record class and discussion proceedings.  All other participants must request permission of the instructor in advance before making any additional recordings.  An instructor’s pre-recorded material, including lectures and class notes, may not be shared with anyone outside of the course’s current enrollment without the consent of the instructor. Similarly, under no circumstances may a recording, still, screenshot, picture, or any other media of any sort be altered or circulated by anyone outside of its original intent. No content may be distributed outside the circle of participants without the consent of all who appear or are heard. The college community is reminded of Allegheny College’s Recording Policy, outlined in 9.8 of the Faculty Handbook, as well as Allegheny’s Statement of Community. Violations will be referred to the Student Conduct system.  Classes may also be recorded if approved as an educational accommodation through the Student Accessibility and Support Services. Faculty are further reminded that recordings of class activities are educational records protected under FERPA. While students do not have a right to be anonymous in a class in which they are enrolled, they have the legal right to be anonymous to third parties. Please direct questions about FERPA to the Registrar.

#### Harassment, Discrimination, and Sexual Misconduct Reporting (prepared by the Title IX Coordinator)

Allegheny College and Federal law (Title IX) prohibit discrimination and harassment on the basis of sex in College’s programs and activities. If you, or someone you know, has experienced sex-based discrimination or harassment, sexual harassment, sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, sexual exploitation, or retaliation contact the College’s Title IX Coordinator to make a report and/or access support and resources:

Gilly Ford, Title IX Coordinator, 814-332-3085 (direct line), `gford@allegheny.edu`

You can access support and resources even if you do not want to take any further action. The College respects your right to file or not file a formal complaint. The Title IX Coordinator must take action only in situations that pose a serious threat of harm to you or the community. 

`Notice that Faculty are Responsible Employees with Mandatory Reporting Obligations:`
Unless specifically identified otherwise by policy, all faculty, staff, and administrators of Allegheny College are considered mandated reporters and are required to notify the College’s Title IX Coordinator of any incident of discrimination and harassment disclosed to them, or known to them, involving a member of the campus community. Mandated reporting helps to ensure that individuals who are experiencing or have experienced discrimination or harassment are connected to the full range of resources and options afforded to them. 
If you are in need of support or advocacy and wish to discuss such matters confidentially, you are invited to consult any of the resources listed below. Unlike other College employees, the options below are confidential and are exempt from mandatory reporting obligations to the Title IX Coordinator. These resources are free and include both internal and external options.
